No one ever returned to the vehicle, according to investigators.</p><p>It\u2019s unclear if there was ever a lead on who that person might have been.</p><p>It also remains unclear whether it was actually Vickie who sent the text messages about meeting someone in Louisville. The person she was reportedly supposed to meet told others the two had not made plans that day.</p><p>Vickie Ellington had light brown or blonde hair, was 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed about 150 pounds.

We had 2 tornados both were classified as Ef1 tornados with maximum winds of 105 mph. The damaged areas was John Peyton Rd for the strom that came out of Pike Co. The other storm came out of Lincoln and that damage was mainly on Foster Rd. We are very blessed we had no injuries.\u201d</p><p>Original story:</p><p>LINCOLN/LAWRENCE COUNTIES \u2014 Two EF1 tornadoes have been confirmed in Lincoln County following severe storms that swept across southwest Mississippi late Saturday night, causing structural damage, downed trees and power outages, according to information first reported by the Brookhaven Daily Leader.</p><p>The National Weather Service in Jackson said meteorologists surveyed damage Sunday from storms that occurred during the night of Saturday, Feb. 14, 2026, and the morning of Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026. Four preliminary tornado tracks were identified in Lincoln and Lawrence counties, with additional surveys planned Monday, Feb. 16, in Lawrence, Jefferson Davis and Covington counties.</p><p>In Lincoln County, the National Weather Service confirmed two EF1 tornadoes after assessing damage, much of it concentrated in and around Bogue Chitto. Lincoln County Emergency Management Director Chris Reid told the Daily Leader that the storm system moved through the area around midnight, damaging homes and outbuildings. Some of the destruction was caused by fallen trees and high winds.</p><p>A mobile home was destroyed after being moved off its blocks, Reid said. As of Sunday, no injuries had been reported, though damage reports were still being received from across the county.</p><p>The first tornado, rated EF1, traveled approximately 6.8 miles along the Norfield track. It began in Summit and ended in Bogue Chitto. Tree damage was most extensive west of Interstate 55, particularly along Jack Lane, Summit Drive, Beechnut Trail, Wallace Drive, Montgomery Road, Dry Creek Trail and Homesville Road.</p><p>The second EF1 tornado, along the Enterprise track, traveled about 2.1 miles from Bogue Chitto to Brookhaven. It began near Mount Olive Road and tracked northeast across Shell Oil Lane and Mississippi Highway 583 before lifting near Highway 583 and Bethel Road.</p><p>Authorities said crews worked through the night and into Sunday morning clearing roads and assessing damage.</p><p>The National Weather Service said the Norfield and Enterprise tornado tracks may receive additional survey work, meaning track details and damage information could be updated as assessments continue.</p><p>The Lawrence County Emergency Management Association said Sunday that the county was \u201cvery blessed\u201d during the storms. The agency reported damage to three homes and two mobile homes on John Payton Lane south of Monticello. No injuries were reported. Power outages occurred throughout the county, and numerous trees were down, blocking roads.</p><p>According to Lawrence County EMA, first responders and supervisors cleared debris, and all roads were reopened as of Sunday.</p>",

The organization later expanded the celebration into Random Acts of Kindness Week, emphasizing that kindness should extend far beyond a single day.</p><p>\u201cMake Kindness the Norm, Not the Exception,\u201d the foundation urges on its website, highlighting the social and emotional benefits of thoughtful actions.</p><p>Research cited by the organization suggests kindness carries measurable health benefits. Acts of generosity can release hormones such as oxytocin and serotonin, which are associated with reduced stress and increased happiness. According to statistics shared by the foundation, people who regularly engage in kind behavior have 23% lower cortisol levels, and a 2020 survey found that 63% of adults reported improved mental health both from receiving and giving kindness.</p><p>Organizers say kindness also strengthens relationships in schools, workplaces and neighborhoods, helping build trust and empathy while breaking down social barriers.</p><p>The movement has attracted more than 261,000 self-described \u201cRAKtivists\u201d in 89 countries, according to RandomActsOfKindness.org . Participants receive a \u201cDaily Dose of Kindness\u00ae\u201d email with ideas and inspiration for incorporating compassion into everyday life.</p><p>While the observance is modern, advocates note that kindness itself is timeless. From community volunteers to global humanitarian figures, history has repeatedly shown how small actions can leave lasting impressions.</p><p>Supporters of the day say participation does not require money or grand gestures. Holding a door, offering encouragement, checking on a neighbor or simply listening can create a ripple effect.</p><p>Random Acts of Kindness Day serves as a reminder that meaningful change often begins with ordinary people choosing to act with care \u2014 one small gesture at a time.</p>",
