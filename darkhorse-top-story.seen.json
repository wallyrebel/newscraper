Organizers say the effort is designed to bridge the gap while residents wait for potential state or federal assistance.</p><p>Rather than establishing a single centralized donation site, participating churches and nonprofit partners are working through their own networks and channels to coordinate giving and distribute aid quickly where it is most needed.</p><p>Initial assistance will focus on urgent needs affecting safety and housing stability, including electrical repairs, plumbing repairs, tree removal and debris hazards. Organizers said additional categories of support may be added as needs are assessed and resources grow.</p><p>Residents of the city of Oxford or Lafayette County experiencing verified storm-related hardship may request assistance through a community intake process. Walk-up intake hours will be held from 9 a.m. to noon Feb. 18 through Feb. 28 at the Old OPC Building, located under the Blue Oxford Water tower at 310 S. 15th St.</p><p>Requests may also be submitted online at https://tinyurl.com/fernhelp or by calling 662-234-1100.</p><p>Applications will be reviewed by a collaborative assessment team led by Doors of Hope in partnership with the North Mississippi Exchange Family Center. The team will verify eligibility, prioritize urgent safety concerns and match approved cases with available resources. When possible, payments will be made directly to licensed vendors or service providers for verified repairs.</p><p>Participating church partners include Oxford-University United Methodist Church , First Baptist Church Oxford , First Presbyterian Church and St. Peter\u2019s Episcopal Church . Community and nonprofit partners include Doors of Hope and the North Mississippi Exchange Family Center .</p><p>Organizers are also building a network of licensed local vendors to assist with recovery work, prioritizing electrical and plumbing repairs and tree removal. Community members may submit vendor information through an online form. Participation in the network does not guarantee work assignments but allows businesses to be considered as recovery needs arise.</p><p>Organizations interested in joining the coordinated fundraising effort may contact Chris McAlilly, lead pastor of Oxford-University United Methodist Church, at [email protected] .</p><p>Organizers said the goal of the fund is to help neighbors recover, rebuild and remain safely housed through a shared community response.</p>",

A stranger offering to carry groceries.</p><p>Those simple moments are at the heart of Random Acts of Kindness Day, observed annually on Feb. 17, a day dedicated to encouraging people to intentionally spread compassion in their communities.</p><p>Founded in 1995 in Denver, Colorado, by the nonprofit Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, the observance has grown into an international movement promoting everyday generosity. The organization later expanded the celebration into Random Acts of Kindness Week, emphasizing that kindness should extend far beyond a single day.</p><p>\u201cMake Kindness the Norm, Not the Exception,\u201d the foundation urges on its website, highlighting the social and emotional benefits of thoughtful actions.</p><p>Research cited by the organization suggests kindness carries measurable health benefits. Acts of generosity can release hormones such as oxytocin and serotonin, which are associated with reduced stress and increased happiness. According to statistics shared by the foundation, people who regularly engage in kind behavior have 23% lower cortisol levels, and a 2020 survey found that 63% of adults reported improved mental health both from receiving and giving kindness.</p><p>Organizers say kindness also strengthens relationships in schools, workplaces and neighborhoods, helping build trust and empathy while breaking down social barriers.</p><p>The movement has attracted more than 261,000 self-described \u201cRAKtivists\u201d in 89 countries, according to RandomActsOfKindness.org . Participants receive a \u201cDaily Dose of Kindness\u00ae\u201d email with ideas and inspiration for incorporating compassion into everyday life.</p><p>While the observance is modern, advocates note that kindness itself is timeless. From community volunteers to global humanitarian figures, history has repeatedly shown how small actions can leave lasting impressions.</p><p>Supporters of the day say participation does not require money or grand gestures. Holding a door, offering encouragement, checking on a neighbor or simply listening can create a ripple effect.</p><p>Random Acts of Kindness Day serves as a reminder that meaningful change often begins with ordinary people choosing to act with care \u2014 one small gesture at a time.</p>",

Hamilton was considering what college to attend, his father made the young high school graduate a generous offer.</p><p>\u201cHe told me, \u2018You can go to any school you want to in the country,\u2019 but the only school he took me to see was Mississippi College,\u201d Hamilton said</p><p>The senior Hamilton, a 1914 MC graduate, may have been a bit biased. But his son earned his undergraduate degree at MC in 1954 and went on to become an internationally celebrated scientist and world-class researcher who co-discovered new elements 113, 115 and 117 in the Periodic Table of Chemistry Elements. He even had the honor of naming atomic element 117 \u2013 Tennessine \u2013 in honor of his home state of Tennessee.</p><p>For decades, Hamilton kept a relic of his father\u2019s college days in Clinton: a black-and-white photo of his father and his classmates standing in front of Provine Chapel on the day of their graduation. With the arrival of MC\u2019s Bicentennial year, he thought the photo belonged at the University.</p><p>On the warm and sunny afternoon of Thursday, Feb. 12, dozens of current MC faculty, staff, students and alumni crowded in front of Provine Chapel to recreate that photo taken more than a century before. Seated right in front on a wooden pew was Joseph H. Hamilton, representing his father in the modern image: two generations of Hamiltons spread 112 years apart.</p><p>\u201cIt was a special occasion that honored him as well as all the graduates of MC,\u201d Hamilton said of the photo recreation.</p><p>The photo followed a recognition of the chapel\u2019s addition to the National Register of Historic Places by MC President Blake Thompson and Stephanie Busbea, dean of the School of Christian Studies, Humanities and the Arts.</p><p>Following many camera clicks, the Choctaw Marching Band played and the crowd sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to MC as Thompson, Tushka, MC\u2019s on-field personality, and student representatives blew out the candles on a three-tier Bicentennial birthday cake.</p><p>\u201cThis once-in-a-lifetime celebration of MC\u2019s 200th birthday united generations of students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful for those who have shaped our story and are inspired by the legacy we carry forward as we begin our next 200 years together.\u201d</p><p>The event kicked off MC\u2019s Bicentennial Birthday Party and other celebratory events, which had been partially postponed by inclement weather during Founders Week in January.</p><p>Students on the Campus Programming Board and MC\u2019s Office of Student Engagement hosted a Bicentennial Birthday Party in the Piazza and Jennings Courtyard that included 200 cupcakes, a photo booth, food and drink vendors, and other activities.</p><p>The \u201c1826: The Exhibition,\u201d which highlights the University\u2019s rich history in a spectacular display created by the Institute for Southern Storytelling at MC, debuted in its namesake campus building, 1826. The exhibit will be open for visitors throughout the Bicentennial year.</p><p>The new Bicentennial Time Capsule, scheduled to be packed with dozens of MC artifacts and reopened sometime in the future, was on display in one of the campus\u2019s historic buildings, Jennings Hall.</p><p>Students and alumni who toured the exhibition and time capsule were simply astounded.</p><p>Cody Scruggs, a sophomore computer science major from Terry, was fascinated by the exhibit\u2019s display of technology used by MC students through the years, especially the old Macintosh personal computer and the early generation iPhone.</p><p>\u201cSeeing all of these things paints a picture in your head of what life in a dorm room could have been like,\u201d Scruggs said. \u201cI\u2019ve been passing by MC since I was 6 years old. Being able to say I was a student here for MC\u2019s 200th birthday celebration is a privilege. Seeing all the different people who have been affiliated with MC being here to celebrate this is amazing.\u201d</p><p>Clinton residents Mary Alta Clark, a 1971 MC graduate, and her daughter, Kim Clark Pigott, who graduated from MC in 1986, participated in the photo recreation and stayed to tour the exhibit. They both recognized items from their respective college days.</p><p>\u201cI remember my grandmother talking about being at Hillman College, which is represented (in the exhibit),\u201d Pigott said. \u201cA lot of our friends and my ex-classmates, people who I know through my children, are represented. I just love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved the diorama of the campus,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt brings back a lot of old memories. I\u2019ve enjoyed watching the different decades. I want to come back, take my time and read about everything.\u201d</p><p>Livi Cate Osborne, a junior Christian Studies major from Birmingham, is the first in her family to attend MC. She said the Bicentennial celebration provides an opportunity for her to share the University\u2019s rich history with her relatives.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved being at MC, and it means so much to show them this place that I\u2019ve made a home for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI love history, so it\u2019s special for me to be a part of the next 200 years.\u201d</p><p>That evening, MC\u2019s Department of Christian Studies hosted a Bicentennial edition of the annual Evangelism Lecture. Shane Pruitt, national next gen director for the North American Mission Board, inspired audience members to take their faith seriously and to share their beliefs with the next generation.</p><p>After a \u201cMeet and Greet\u201d with Mississippi College\u2019s first Black graduates, the African American Studies program at MC presented \u201cSuccess Starts at Mississippi College: Chronicles of MC\u2019s African American Contributions to 200 Years of Celebration.\u201d Moderated by Ellis Liddell \u201980, co-chair of the Bicentennial Celebration Committee, the event featured MC alumni panelists Larry Myricks \u201979, Maggie Wade \u201920, Regina Schofield \u201983, Camryn Johnson \u201922, and Aaron Feazelle \u201920.</p><p>On Friday morning, Feb. 13, Liddell, fellow members of the Bicentennial Celebration Committee, and guests witnessed Thompson unveil a sign outside Alumni Hall acknowledging the support of those \u201cwho helped ensure the success of this historic (Bicentennial) celebration.\u201d</p><p>During the brunch that followed, Jim Turcotte, MC vice president and special assistant to the president, recognized members of the Bicentennial Celebration Committee and Bicentennial Working Group and their efforts to make the Bicentennial Celebration a success.</p><p>\u201cI am immensely grateful for the contributions of the MC Bicentennial Celebration Committee, the MC Bicentennial Working Group, and many other MC faculty, staff and student volunteers who have been the driving force behind our celebration activities,\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cI appreciate each of you and thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u201d</p><p>Liddell closed by encouraging the committee members to continue telling the story of Mississippi College throughout its Bicentennial year and beyond.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a certain culture that we have as a result of who we are and how we grew up here,\u201d Liddell said. \u201cWe must take that culture and share it with the rest of the world. This college has a purpose, and that\u2019s what makes Mississippi College special.\u201d</p>",

That equates to an estimated 12,659 seniors statewide who experienced a full month without meaningful social contact.</p><p>The findings come as national health experts warn that chronic loneliness can carry health risks comparable to smoking heavily. U.S. leaders, including the former U.S. surgeon general, have described social isolation as a public health crisis, particularly among older Americans.</p><p>Choice Mutual surveyed 3,025 seniors nationwide at the end of January, asking a single question: \u201cHas anyone checked in on you since January 1?\u201d</p><p>Overall, 26% said no, and Mississippi\u2019s rate exceeded the national average.</p><p>The survey identified the five states with the highest share of seniors living alone who reported zero check-ins in January: Wyoming and Oklahoma at 50%, followed by Louisiana at 44%, and Arizona and Connecticut at 42%.</p><p>Beyond the headline number, the survey painted a broader picture of winter isolation.</p><p>Among seniors living alone nationwide:</p><p>The emotional toll appears to run deep. Sixty-eight percent said they feel forgotten or invisible during the winter. Nearly three in 10, or 29%, said they do not have even one person they can confide in during difficult times.</p><p>More than half, 58%, said they worry their loneliness is harming their health, and 62% reported that isolation affected their physical or mental health this winter.</p><p>Even seniors who do not live alone are not immune. The survey found that 65% of older adults who live with a partner still sometimes feel alone.</p><p>Anthony Martin, founder of Choice Mutual , said the results should be viewed as a warning.</p><p>\u201cLoneliness is often dismissed as a soft issue, but the numbers show it\u2019s anything but,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWhen a quarter of seniors go a full month without a check-in, that\u2019s not just a social concern \u2014 it\u2019s a public-health warning light.\u201d</p><p>He said many seniors are not seeking major interventions, but simple connection.</p><p>\u201cIn many cases, a simple phone call or knock on the door would make a meaningful difference,\u201d Martin said.</p><p>The survey also highlighted how difficult it can be for seniors to break the cycle of isolation. While 28% said they are very likely to reach out when feeling lonely, 40% said they are unlikely or very unlikely to do so.</p><p>Still, 64% said their well-being would improve if someone reached out more often.</p><p>As winter continues and social isolation remains a concern nationwide, advocates say small acts of connection \u2014 a call, a visit or a check-in \u2014 may be among the most powerful tools to combat what many now consider one of the country\u2019s most overlooked health threats.</p>",
