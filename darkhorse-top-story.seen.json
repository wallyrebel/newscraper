Hamilton was considering what college to attend, his father made the young high school graduate a generous offer.</p><p>\u201cHe told me, \u2018You can go to any school you want to in the country,\u2019 but the only school he took me to see was Mississippi College,\u201d Hamilton said</p><p>The senior Hamilton, a 1914 MC graduate, may have been a bit biased. But his son earned his undergraduate degree at MC in 1954 and went on to become an internationally celebrated scientist and world-class researcher who co-discovered new elements 113, 115 and 117 in the Periodic Table of Chemistry Elements. He even had the honor of naming atomic element 117 \u2013 Tennessine \u2013 in honor of his home state of Tennessee.</p><p>For decades, Hamilton kept a relic of his father\u2019s college days in Clinton: a black-and-white photo of his father and his classmates standing in front of Provine Chapel on the day of their graduation. With the arrival of MC\u2019s Bicentennial year, he thought the photo belonged at the University.</p><p>On the warm and sunny afternoon of Thursday, Feb. 12, dozens of current MC faculty, staff, students and alumni crowded in front of Provine Chapel to recreate that photo taken more than a century before. Seated right in front on a wooden pew was Joseph H. Hamilton, representing his father in the modern image: two generations of Hamiltons spread 112 years apart.</p><p>\u201cIt was a special occasion that honored him as well as all the graduates of MC,\u201d Hamilton said of the photo recreation.</p><p>The photo followed a recognition of the chapel\u2019s addition to the National Register of Historic Places by MC President Blake Thompson and Stephanie Busbea, dean of the School of Christian Studies, Humanities and the Arts.</p><p>Following many camera clicks, the Choctaw Marching Band played and the crowd sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to MC as Thompson, Tushka, MC\u2019s on-field personality, and student representatives blew out the candles on a three-tier Bicentennial birthday cake.</p><p>\u201cThis once-in-a-lifetime celebration of MC\u2019s 200th birthday united generations of students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful for those who have shaped our story and are inspired by the legacy we carry forward as we begin our next 200 years together.\u201d</p><p>The event kicked off MC\u2019s Bicentennial Birthday Party and other celebratory events, which had been partially postponed by inclement weather during Founders Week in January.</p><p>Students on the Campus Programming Board and MC\u2019s Office of Student Engagement hosted a Bicentennial Birthday Party in the Piazza and Jennings Courtyard that included 200 cupcakes, a photo booth, food and drink vendors, and other activities.</p><p>The \u201c1826: The Exhibition,\u201d which highlights the University\u2019s rich history in a spectacular display created by the Institute for Southern Storytelling at MC, debuted in its namesake campus building, 1826. The exhibit will be open for visitors throughout the Bicentennial year.</p><p>The new Bicentennial Time Capsule, scheduled to be packed with dozens of MC artifacts and reopened sometime in the future, was on display in one of the campus\u2019s historic buildings, Jennings Hall.</p><p>Students and alumni who toured the exhibition and time capsule were simply astounded.</p><p>Cody Scruggs, a sophomore computer science major from Terry, was fascinated by the exhibit\u2019s display of technology used by MC students through the years, especially the old Macintosh personal computer and the early generation iPhone.</p><p>\u201cSeeing all of these things paints a picture in your head of what life in a dorm room could have been like,\u201d Scruggs said. \u201cI\u2019ve been passing by MC since I was 6 years old. Being able to say I was a student here for MC\u2019s 200th birthday celebration is a privilege. Seeing all the different people who have been affiliated with MC being here to celebrate this is amazing.\u201d</p><p>Clinton residents Mary Alta Clark, a 1971 MC graduate, and her daughter, Kim Clark Pigott, who graduated from MC in 1986, participated in the photo recreation and stayed to tour the exhibit. They both recognized items from their respective college days.</p><p>\u201cI remember my grandmother talking about being at Hillman College, which is represented (in the exhibit),\u201d Pigott said. \u201cA lot of our friends and my ex-classmates, people who I know through my children, are represented.

I want to come back, take my time and read about everything.\u201d</p><p>Livi Cate Osborne, a junior Christian Studies major from Birmingham, is the first in her family to attend MC. She said the Bicentennial celebration provides an opportunity for her to share the University\u2019s rich history with her relatives.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved being at MC, and it means so much to show them this place that I\u2019ve made a home for myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI love history, so it\u2019s special for me to be a part of the next 200 years.\u201d</p><p>That evening, MC\u2019s Department of Christian Studies hosted a Bicentennial edition of the annual Evangelism Lecture. Shane Pruitt, national next gen director for the North American Mission Board, inspired audience members to take their faith seriously and to share their beliefs with the next generation.</p><p>After a \u201cMeet and Greet\u201d with Mississippi College\u2019s first Black graduates, the African American Studies program at MC presented \u201cSuccess Starts at Mississippi College: Chronicles of MC\u2019s African American Contributions to 200 Years of Celebration.\u201d Moderated by Ellis Liddell \u201980, co-chair of the Bicentennial Celebration Committee, the event featured MC alumni panelists Larry Myricks \u201979, Maggie Wade \u201920, Regina Schofield \u201983, Camryn Johnson \u201922, and Aaron Feazelle \u201920.</p><p>On Friday morning, Feb. 13, Liddell, fellow members of the Bicentennial Celebration Committee, and guests witnessed Thompson unveil a sign outside Alumni Hall acknowledging the support of those \u201cwho helped ensure the success of this historic (Bicentennial) celebration.\u201d</p><p>During the brunch that followed, Jim Turcotte, MC vice president and special assistant to the president, recognized members of the Bicentennial Celebration Committee and Bicentennial Working Group and their efforts to make the Bicentennial Celebration a success.</p><p>\u201cI am immensely grateful for the contributions of the MC Bicentennial Celebration Committee, the MC Bicentennial Working Group, and many other MC faculty, staff and student volunteers who have been the driving force behind our celebration activities,\u201d Turcotte said. \u201cI appreciate each of you and thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u201d</p><p>Liddell closed by encouraging the committee members to continue telling the story of Mississippi College throughout its Bicentennial year and beyond.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a certain culture that we have as a result of who we are and how we grew up here,\u201d Liddell said. \u201cWe must take that culture and share it with the rest of the world. This college has a purpose, and that\u2019s what makes Mississippi College special.\u201d</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>JACKSON \u2014 Nearly one-third of Mississippi seniors who live alone went the entire month of January without a single meaningful check-in, underscoring concerns about what health officials have called a growing loneliness epidemic in America.</p><p>A new survey by Choice Mutual found that 32% of Mississippi residents age 65 and older who live alone reported no one had checked on them since Jan. 1. That equates to an estimated 12,659 seniors statewide who experienced a full month without meaningful social contact.</p><p>The findings come as national health experts warn that chronic loneliness can carry health risks comparable to smoking heavily. U.S. leaders, including the former U.S. surgeon general, have described social isolation as a public health crisis, particularly among older Americans.</p><p>Choice Mutual surveyed 3,025 seniors nationwide at the end of January, asking a single question: \u201cHas anyone checked in on you since January 1?\u201d</p><p>Overall, 26% said no, and Mississippi\u2019s rate exceeded the national average.</p><p>The survey identified the five states with the highest share of seniors living alone who reported zero check-ins in January: Wyoming and Oklahoma at 50%, followed by Louisiana at 44%, and Arizona and Connecticut at 42%.</p><p>Beyond the headline number, the survey painted a broader picture of winter isolation.</p><p>Among seniors living alone nationwide:</p><p>The emotional toll appears to run deep. Sixty-eight percent said they feel forgotten or invisible during the winter. Nearly three in 10, or 29%, said they do not have even one person they can confide in during difficult times.</p><p>More than half, 58%, said they worry their loneliness is harming their health, and 62% reported that isolation affected their physical or mental health this winter.</p><p>Even seniors who do not live alone are not immune. The survey found that 65% of older adults who live with a partner still sometimes feel alone.</p><p>Anthony Martin, founder of Choice Mutual , said the results should be viewed as a warning.</p><p>\u201cLoneliness is often dismissed as a soft issue, but the numbers show it\u2019s anything but,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWhen a quarter of seniors go a full month without a check-in, that\u2019s not just a social concern \u2014 it\u2019s a public-health warning light.\u201d</p><p>He said many seniors are not seeking major interventions, but simple connection.</p><p>\u201cIn many cases, a simple phone call or knock on the door would make a meaningful difference,\u201d Martin said.</p><p>The survey also highlighted how difficult it can be for seniors to break the cycle of isolation. While 28% said they are very likely to reach out when feeling lonely, 40% said they are unlikely or very unlikely to do so.</p><p>Still, 64% said their well-being would improve if someone reached out more often.</p><p>As winter continues and social isolation remains a concern nationwide, advocates say small acts of connection \u2014 a call, a visit or a check-in \u2014 may be among the most powerful tools to combat what many now consider one of the country\u2019s most overlooked health threats.</p>",

Prentiss Drive and Fatherland Road, according to previous reporting by WLBT and statements from Natchez Police Department Commander Jerry Ford.</p><p>Ford told reporters that officers noticed drug paraphernalia inside the small pickup truck after making contact with the driver.</p><p>\u201cThe officer who was backing up went up to the driver door, made contact with the driver and noticed paraphernalia inside of his vehicle,\u201d Ford said.</p><p>After the driver was detained, he told officers he had information about a corpse in the nearby area.</p><p>\u201cThe suspect at that time stated to him that he had information about a corpse in the nearby area,\u201d Ford said.</p><p>Officers called for backup and searched a wooded area about 10 feet off the road between Fatherland Road and the turnoff to First Lutheran Church. Beneath fallen leaves, they discovered skeletal remains buried in a shallow grave about 10 feet into the woods.</p><p>The remains were largely intact, but the head was missing. Authorities said the body had been there for a significant amount of time. At the time, no missing persons reports appeared to match the victim\u2019s identity, and investigators declined to speculate about the detainee\u2019s potential role or knowledge.</p><p>The Mississippi State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office determined the remains belonged to an adult male estimated to be between 5 feet 9 inches and 6 feet 4 inches tall. An identification card found nearby suggested the man could have been around 70 years old, but officials could not confirm his identity. The case was entered into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System as UP124871.</p><p>In June 2024, the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office partnered with Othram, a forensic laboratory based in The Woodlands, Texas, to apply advanced DNA testing. According to Othram Labs, scientists used Forensic-Grade Genome Sequencing\u00ae to develop a DNA profile and conducted a forensic genetic genealogy search that generated new investigative leads.</p><p>Investigators later collected a reference DNA sample from a possible relative. Using Othram\u2019s KinSNP\u00ae rapid relationship testing, scientists confirmed a close relationship, leading to the identification of the remains as Harrington, who was from Kentucky.</p><p>Othram said the advanced DNA testing and genealogy work in the case were funded through donations made via its DNASolves\u00ae crowdfunding platform.</p><p>The company said the identification marks the 38th publicly announced case in Mississippi in which officials have used Othram\u2019s identity inference technology to help name unidentified remains.</p>",

      "content_html": "<p>USA \u2014 National Caregivers Day, observed the third Friday in February, honors the millions of Americans who provide daily care to loved ones, patients and residents, often with little recognition and, in most cases, no pay at all.</p><p>The observance was established in 2015 by the Providers Association for Home Health &amp; Hospice Agencies, known as PAHHHA, according to NationalToday.com. The first celebration took place in 2016, with the goal of dedicating a day each year to recognize and appreciate caregivers everywhere.</p><p>Caregivers provide everything from medical aid to personal grooming, feeding, and providing comfort and companionship. Yet across the board, many are underappreciated, underpaid or unpaid.</p><p>The scope of caregiving in the United States is vast. The National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP reported that in 2020, an estimated 53 million Americans provided unpaid care to an adult or child. One in five U.S. adults offers unpaid care to an adult family member, according to surveys cited by Radiant Senior Living .</p><p>The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index found caregivers spend an average of six days each month grooming, feeding, dressing, bathing and walking those in their care. They spend 13 days a month commuting, cleaning, doing laundry, monitoring medication, shopping and preparing special meals. Another 13 hours monthly are devoted to coordinating doctor visits, researching symptoms and managing finances, NationalToday.com reports.</p><p>Those are black and white averages in articles written on the internet. To many Americans, it\u2019s 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.</p><p>Women shoulder much of that responsibility. The Institute on Aging reports that more than three-quarters of caregivers are female and spend 50% more time providing essential services than men. Nearly 75% of caregivers are women, according to data cited by RadiantSeniorLiving.com.</p><p>Caregiving can take a toll. Per the National Alliance for Caregiving, 23% of Americans say caregiving has harmed their health. Nearly 40% of caregivers over age 50 describe the emotional strain as highly demanding, and 42% report a financial impact from their caregiving responsibilities.</p><p>Many caregivers are older adults themselves. NationalToday.com reports the average age of someone caring for a person 65 or older is 63. As the number of hours devoted to caregiving increases, many report their own health challenges.</p><p>Professional caregivers also face demanding schedules and emotional labor. Radiant Senior Living notes that professional caregivers \u201cfrequently treat their patients and residents as if they were members of their own families,\u201d providing consistent care and compassion.</p><p>National Caregivers Day recognizes both professional and informal caregivers, including friends, family members, pastors, and even surviving parents navigating grief while supporting children who have lost a parent.</p><p>Psychology Today highlights the unique challenges facing grieving caregivers, especially surviving parents.</p><p>\u201cThe well-being of a caregiver who is grieving is essential to their child\u2019s well-being,\u201d Rebecca Hobbs-Lawrence, M.A., of the Dougy Center for Grieving Children &amp; Families, told the publication. \u201cCaregivers need space to grieve themselves and to seek the support of others.\u201d</p><p>She said it is helpful for caregivers to dedicate time to their own thoughts and feelings, whether through walking, journaling, making art or simply sitting quietly.</p><p>Experts and advocacy groups say small gestures can make a significant difference. Writing a positive review, sending a handwritten thank-you note, offering respite care, assisting with errands or simply acknowledging a caregiver\u2019s efforts are meaningful ways to show appreciation.</p><p>For that son or daughter who is caring for their ailing parent, which is physically, financially, personally, spiritually, and emotionally devastating, simply taking them to lunch or coffee, listening to them talk about what they\u2019re going through, and letting them know they\u2019re seen and not alone is a priceless gift.</p><p>NationalToday.com notes that caregivers\u2019 \u201cspecial kindness and patience\u201d deserve year-round recognition. On National Caregivers Day, supporters are encouraged to check in, offer help and remember that caring for the caregiver is just as important as caring for those they serve.</p>",
