Investigators later determined the shooting occurred near the intersection of Mississippi Highway 53 and Barth Road in Poplarville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheriff’s office said the suspected gunman was identified as Austyn Reynolds, and investigators also identified a Nissan Altima as the suspected vehicle involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities said Michelle Rogers was identified as an accomplice who allegedly helped Reynolds attempt to evade law enforcement after the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a coordinated effort between the Pearl River County Sheriff’s Office and the Bogalusa Police Department, Reynolds and Rogers were taken into custody without incident, the sheriff’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators later determined that Shyanne Thibodeaux also assisted Reynolds and Rogers in evading law enforcement after the shooting, authorities said. An arrest warrant remains outstanding for Thibodeaux, the sheriff’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds was arrested and charged with drive-by shooting under Mississippi Code Section 97-3-109(1). Rogers was charged with accessory after the fact to drive-by shooting under Mississippi Code Section 97-1-5(1)(a)(i), authorities said. Thibodeaux faces an outstanding warrant for accessory after the fact to drive-by shooting under the same statute, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheriff David Allison thanked the Bogalusa Police Department and the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office for assisting in the investigation and said deputies and investigators worked to resolve what he described as a violent crime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That equates to an estimated 12,659 seniors statewide who experienced a full month without meaningful social contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come as national health experts warn that chronic loneliness can carry health risks comparable to smoking heavily. U.S. leaders, including the former U.S. surgeon general, have described social isolation as a public health crisis, particularly among older Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choice Mutual surveyed 3,025 seniors nationwide at the end of January, asking a single question: “Has anyone checked in on you since January 1?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 26% said no, and Mississippi’s rate exceeded the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey identified the five states with the highest share of seniors living alone who reported zero check-ins in January: Wyoming and Oklahoma at 50%, followed by Louisiana at 44%, and Arizona and Connecticut at 42%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the headline number, the survey painted a broader picture of winter isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among seniors living alone nationwide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emotional toll appears to run deep. Sixty-eight percent said they feel forgotten or invisible during the winter. Nearly three in 10, or 29%, said they do not have even one person they can confide in during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half, 58%, said they worry their loneliness is harming their health, and 62% reported that isolation affected their physical or mental health this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even seniors who do not live alone are not immune. The survey found that 65% of older adults who live with a partner still sometimes feel alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Martin, founder of Choice Mutual , said the results should be viewed as a warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness is often dismissed as a soft issue, but the numbers show it’s anything but,” Martin said. “When a quarter of seniors go a full month without a check-in, that’s not just a social concern — it’s a public-health warning light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said many seniors are not seeking major interventions, but simple connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many cases, a simple phone call or knock on the door would make a meaningful difference,” Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also highlighted how difficult it can be for seniors to break the cycle of isolation. While 28% said they are very likely to reach out when feeling lonely, 40% said they are unlikely or very unlikely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, 64% said their well-being would improve if someone reached out more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As winter continues and social isolation remains a concern nationwide, advocates say small acts of connection — a call, a visit or a check-in — may be among the most powerful tools to combat what many now consider one of the country’s most overlooked health threats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The van struck a pole, overturned and collided with a utility truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi Highway Patrol said there were four people inside the transport van and one person in the utility truck. Two people in the van, an officer and a prisoner, died, and the other two occupants in the van were critically injured, WLOX reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The utility truck driver was taken to a local hospital in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WLOX reported a medical helicopter was called to transport one of the most critically injured victims. After the crash, the van caught fire, and the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office arrived first and put out the fire, according to the station. Jackson County Fire then cut into the van to rescue those inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transport van was operated by St. Joseph Services, a private prisoner transport company, WLOX reported. The station said the trip began Tuesday night and involved prisoners picked up in Florida, with planned destinations including Ocean City, New Jersey, and Spaulding, Georgia. The van was also in Mississippi to pick up an inmate from the Harrison County Adult Detention Center when it crashed, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple agencies responded and a crash reconstruction was conducted. The cause of the crash had not been released as of Wednesday, WLOX reported.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Upon arrival, officers found a Black male deceased inside the vacant property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s apparent that he had been shot at least once,” Jones said during a press conference at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The killing marks Jackson’s eighth homicide of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities believe the victim may be the same individual reported missing earlier Tuesday in Jackson. However, Jones said investigators are awaiting formal identification and family notification before releasing the name. The victim is believed to be in his early 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators also reported that a 2020 gray Nissan Sentra belonging to the victim is missing from the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said officers were alerted to the area based on information that the missing person could be nearby. Family members of the missing individual were also in the area and spoke with officers, leading to the discovery of the body inside the vacant home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police do not believe the victim lived at the residence and said the property is unoccupied. Investigators are working to determine why the victim was at the location and what connection, if any, exists between him and the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities have not identified a motive and said the case remains under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with information is asked to contact the Jackson Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The group alleged the chains were too short and too heavy, and that the dogs did not have proper shelter or water. The rescue also said the animals did not have required rabies vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than face potential citations, the people at the home relinquished the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheshire Abbey said it is currently at capacity following recent cold-weather rescues and plans to board the dogs while they are assessed. The rescue said it evaluates animals before adoption and does not place aggressive dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group praised law enforcement partners involved in the response and asked the community for donations to help cover boarding and veterinary costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can donate to their care on the rescue’s Facebook post by clicking below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These rescues cannot do this by themselves. It takes a village to help the forgotten dogs discarded in Mississippi every single day.

The group alleged the chains were too short and too heavy, and that the dogs did not have proper shelter or water. The rescue also said the animals did not have required rabies vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than face potential citations, the people at the home relinquished the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheshire Abbey said it is currently at capacity following recent cold-weather rescues and plans to board the dogs while they are assessed. The rescue said it evaluates animals before adoption and does not place aggressive dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group praised law enforcement partners involved in the response and asked the community for donations to help cover boarding and veterinary costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can donate to their care on the rescue’s Facebook post by clicking below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These rescues cannot do this by themselves. It takes a village to help the forgotten dogs discarded in Mississippi every single day. It is exhausting for a small group to do alone…so whether you skip your daily $5 coffee and donate, that or reach out and offer to foster, we challenge you to do something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be something big or small…but please do something.&lt;/p&gt;</ns1:encoded>

Additional adoption events will be held Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at PetSmart in Hattiesburg, and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Petco in Hattiesburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s event at PetSmart coincides with “Adopt Joy,” a partnership with PetSmart Charities aimed at connecting families with pets. Shelter officials said research shows pet ownership can benefit cognitive, physical and emotional wellness and help children learn values such as patience and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All adoptions include age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter surgery, a microchip, 30 days of pet health insurance and a sample bag of food. The shelter said the reduced fees cover those services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1952, Southern Pines operates a no-kill shelter that cares for more than 4,000 lost and unwanted dogs and cats each year. The organization also runs a transport program, thrift shops in Hattiesburg and Oak Grove and a low-cost veterinary clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelter hours are noon to 5 p.m. Thursday through Tuesday. The shelter is closed Wednesdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said those unable to adopt can support the effort through donations to assist with the care of animals awaiting homes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Harper is charged with murder and felon in possession of a firearm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victim was identified as Kynjarious Rockingham, 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precinct 1 officers were dispatched about 12:30 a.m. Feb. 16 to the Chapel Ridge Apartments in the 1600 block of Raymond Road after receiving a report of a deceased person in the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When officers arrived, they found an adult male lying on the ground. Detectives with the Robbery/Homicide Unit, the Mobile Crime Unit and the Hinds County coroner responded to the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators determined Rockingham had suffered at least one gunshot wound and died from his injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities have not released a possible motive in the case. It was not immediately clear whether Harper has an attorney or when she is expected to appear in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shooting marked the city’s seventh homicide of the year, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A handwritten note left on a coworker’s desk. A stranger offering to carry groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those simple moments are at the heart of Random Acts of Kindness Day, observed annually on Feb. 17, a day dedicated to encouraging people to intentionally spread compassion in their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1995 in Denver, Colorado, by the nonprofit Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, the observance has grown into an international movement promoting everyday generosity. The organization later expanded the celebration into Random Acts of Kindness Week, emphasizing that kindness should extend far beyond a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Make Kindness the Norm, Not the Exception,” the foundation urges on its website, highlighting the social and emotional benefits of thoughtful actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research cited by the organization suggests kindness carries measurable health benefits. Acts of generosity can release hormones such as oxytocin and serotonin, which are associated with reduced stress and increased happiness. According to statistics shared by the foundation, people who regularly engage in kind behavior have 23% lower cortisol levels, and a 2020 survey found that 63% of adults reported improved mental health both from receiving and giving kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers say kindness also strengthens relationships in schools, workplaces and neighborhoods, helping build trust and empathy while breaking down social barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movement has attracted more than 261,000 self-described “RAKtivists” in 89 countries, according to RandomActsOfKindness.org . Participants receive a “Daily Dose of Kindness®” email with ideas and inspiration for incorporating compassion into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the observance is modern, advocates note that kindness itself is timeless. From community volunteers to global humanitarian figures, history has repeatedly shown how small actions can leave lasting impressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the day say participation does not require money or grand gestures. Holding a door, offering encouragement, checking on a neighbor or simply listening can create a ripple effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random Acts of Kindness Day serves as a reminder that meaningful change often begins with ordinary people choosing to act with care — one small gesture at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

According to statistics shared by the foundation, people who regularly engage in kind behavior have 23% lower cortisol levels, and a 2020 survey found that 63% of adults reported improved mental health both from receiving and giving kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers say kindness also strengthens relationships in schools, workplaces and neighborhoods, helping build trust and empathy while breaking down social barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movement has attracted more than 261,000 self-described “RAKtivists” in 89 countries, according to RandomActsOfKindness.org . Participants receive a “Daily Dose of Kindness®” email with ideas and inspiration for incorporating compassion into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the observance is modern, advocates note that kindness itself is timeless. From community volunteers to global humanitarian figures, history has repeatedly shown how small actions can leave lasting impressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the day say participation does not require money or grand gestures. Holding a door, offering encouragement, checking on a neighbor or simply listening can create a ripple effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random Acts of Kindness Day serves as a reminder that meaningful change often begins with ordinary people choosing to act with care — one small gesture at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</ns1:encoded>

Organizers say the effort is designed to bridge the gap while residents wait for potential state or federal assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than establishing a single centralized donation site, participating churches and nonprofit partners are working through their own networks and channels to coordinate giving and distribute aid quickly where it is most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial assistance will focus on urgent needs affecting safety and housing stability, including electrical repairs, plumbing repairs, tree removal and debris hazards. Organizers said additional categories of support may be added as needs are assessed and resources grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents of the city of Oxford or Lafayette County experiencing verified storm-related hardship may request assistance through a community intake process. Walk-up intake hours will be held from 9 a.m. to noon Feb. 18 through Feb. 28 at the Old OPC Building, located under the Blue Oxford Water tower at 310 S. 15th St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requests may also be submitted online at https://tinyurl.com/fernhelp or by calling 662-234-1100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applications will be reviewed by a collaborative assessment team led by Doors of Hope in partnership with the North Mississippi Exchange Family Center. The team will verify eligibility, prioritize urgent safety concerns and match approved cases with available resources. When possible, payments will be made directly to licensed vendors or service providers for verified repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participating church partners include Oxford-University United Methodist Church , First Baptist Church Oxford , First Presbyterian Church and St. Peter’s Episcopal Church . Community and nonprofit partners include Doors of Hope and the North Mississippi Exchange Family Center .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers are also building a network of licensed local vendors to assist with recovery work, prioritizing electrical and plumbing repairs and tree removal. Community members may submit vendor information through an online form. Participation in the network does not guarantee work assignments but allows businesses to be considered as recovery needs arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations interested in joining the coordinated fundraising effort may contact Chris McAlilly, lead pastor of Oxford-University United Methodist Church, at [email protected] .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers said the goal of the fund is to help neighbors recover, rebuild and remain safely housed through a shared community response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A Lee County Justice Court judge set his bond at $500,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation remains ongoing, and additional charges may be filed as new information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheriff’s office expressed appreciation to Child Protective Services and the Easter Seals of Mississippi Child Advocacy Center for their assistance in the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

University officials said the funding renews Jackson State’s role in the long-running Jackson Heart Study collaboration, which they describe as the largest investigation of cardiovascular disease in African Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson State said it has received more than $25 million in NIH funding related to the study since 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interim President Denise Jones Gregory said the new award reflects the university’s ability to secure major federal research partnerships and support health outcomes for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease remains a leading cause of death in the United States, and African Americans face higher rates, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The university said related conditions, including hypertension, obesity and diabetes, also disproportionately affect Black communities and contribute to cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in 1998, the Jackson Heart Study has followed more than 5,300 participants ages 34 to 85 in the Jackson metropolitan area, building long-term health data and biological samples used for research and prevention efforts. The program marked a 25-year milestone last year tied to its first participant clinical exam in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Graduate Training and Education Center at Jackson State was established in 2013 to prepare graduate students for careers in biomedical and public health sciences, with an emphasis on disease prevention and health promotion in underserved communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marinelle Payton, principal investigator of the center at Jackson State, said the renewed funding will help train future public health leaders to translate cardiovascular research into prevention strategies and earlier care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Almesha Campbell, the university’s vice president for research and economic development, said the award strengthens Jackson State’s research role while expanding workforce development focused on health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partner institutions in the Jackson Heart Study collaboration include the University of Mississippi Medical Center, Tougaloo College, the University of Southern Mississippi, Wake Forest University and the G.A.
