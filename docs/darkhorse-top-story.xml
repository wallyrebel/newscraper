Investigators later determined the shooting occurred near the intersection of Mississippi Highway 53 and Barth Road in Poplarville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheriff’s office said the suspected gunman was identified as Austyn Reynolds, and investigators also identified a Nissan Altima as the suspected vehicle involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities said Michelle Rogers was identified as an accomplice who allegedly helped Reynolds attempt to evade law enforcement after the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a coordinated effort between the Pearl River County Sheriff’s Office and the Bogalusa Police Department, Reynolds and Rogers were taken into custody without incident, the sheriff’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators later determined that Shyanne Thibodeaux also assisted Reynolds and Rogers in evading law enforcement after the shooting, authorities said. An arrest warrant remains outstanding for Thibodeaux, the sheriff’s office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reynolds was arrested and charged with drive-by shooting under Mississippi Code Section 97-3-109(1). Rogers was charged with accessory after the fact to drive-by shooting under Mississippi Code Section 97-1-5(1)(a)(i), authorities said. Thibodeaux faces an outstanding warrant for accessory after the fact to drive-by shooting under the same statute, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheriff David Allison thanked the Bogalusa Police Department and the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office for assisting in the investigation and said deputies and investigators worked to resolve what he described as a violent crime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That equates to an estimated 12,659 seniors statewide who experienced a full month without meaningful social contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come as national health experts warn that chronic loneliness can carry health risks comparable to smoking heavily. U.S. leaders, including the former U.S. surgeon general, have described social isolation as a public health crisis, particularly among older Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choice Mutual surveyed 3,025 seniors nationwide at the end of January, asking a single question: “Has anyone checked in on you since January 1?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 26% said no, and Mississippi’s rate exceeded the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey identified the five states with the highest share of seniors living alone who reported zero check-ins in January: Wyoming and Oklahoma at 50%, followed by Louisiana at 44%, and Arizona and Connecticut at 42%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the headline number, the survey painted a broader picture of winter isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among seniors living alone nationwide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emotional toll appears to run deep. Sixty-eight percent said they feel forgotten or invisible during the winter. Nearly three in 10, or 29%, said they do not have even one person they can confide in during difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half, 58%, said they worry their loneliness is harming their health, and 62% reported that isolation affected their physical or mental health this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even seniors who do not live alone are not immune. The survey found that 65% of older adults who live with a partner still sometimes feel alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Martin, founder of Choice Mutual , said the results should be viewed as a warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness is often dismissed as a soft issue, but the numbers show it’s anything but,” Martin said. “When a quarter of seniors go a full month without a check-in, that’s not just a social concern — it’s a public-health warning light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said many seniors are not seeking major interventions, but simple connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many cases, a simple phone call or knock on the door would make a meaningful difference,” Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also highlighted how difficult it can be for seniors to break the cycle of isolation. While 28% said they are very likely to reach out when feeling lonely, 40% said they are unlikely or very unlikely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, 64% said their well-being would improve if someone reached out more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As winter continues and social isolation remains a concern nationwide, advocates say small acts of connection — a call, a visit or a check-in — may be among the most powerful tools to combat what many now consider one of the country’s most overlooked health threats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The van struck a pole, overturned and collided with a utility truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi Highway Patrol said there were four people inside the transport van and one person in the utility truck. Two people in the van, an officer and a prisoner, died, and the other two occupants in the van were critically injured, WLOX reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The utility truck driver was taken to a local hospital in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WLOX reported a medical helicopter was called to transport one of the most critically injured victims. After the crash, the van caught fire, and the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office arrived first and put out the fire, according to the station. Jackson County Fire then cut into the van to rescue those inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transport van was operated by St. Joseph Services, a private prisoner transport company, WLOX reported. The station said the trip began Tuesday night and involved prisoners picked up in Florida, with planned destinations including Ocean City, New Jersey, and Spaulding, Georgia. The van was also in Mississippi to pick up an inmate from the Harrison County Adult Detention Center when it crashed, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple agencies responded and a crash reconstruction was conducted.

Upon arrival, officers found a Black male deceased inside the vacant property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s apparent that he had been shot at least once,” Jones said during a press conference at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The killing marks Jackson’s eighth homicide of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities believe the victim may be the same individual reported missing earlier Tuesday in Jackson.

Family members of the missing individual were also in the area and spoke with officers, leading to the discovery of the body inside the vacant home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police do not believe the victim lived at the residence and said the property is unoccupied.

Hamilton was considering what college to attend, his father made the young high school graduate a generous offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He told me, ‘You can go to any school you want to in the country,’ but the only school he took me to see was Mississippi College,” Hamilton said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior Hamilton, a 1914 MC graduate, may have been a bit biased. But his son earned his undergraduate degree at MC in 1954 and went on to become an internationally celebrated scientist and world-class researcher who co-discovered new elements 113, 115 and 117 in the Periodic Table of Chemistry Elements. He even had the honor of naming atomic element 117 – Tennessine – in honor of his home state of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Hamilton kept a relic of his father’s college days in Clinton: a black-and-white photo of his father and his classmates standing in front of Provine Chapel on the day of their graduation. With the arrival of MC’s Bicentennial year, he thought the photo belonged at the University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the warm and sunny afternoon of Thursday, Feb. 12, dozens of current MC faculty, staff, students and alumni crowded in front of Provine Chapel to recreate that photo taken more than a century before. Seated right in front on a wooden pew was Joseph H. Hamilton, representing his father in the modern image: two generations of Hamiltons spread 112 years apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a special occasion that honored him as well as all the graduates of MC,” Hamilton said of the photo recreation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photo followed a recognition of the chapel’s addition to the National Register of Historic Places by MC President Blake Thompson and Stephanie Busbea, dean of the School of Christian Studies, Humanities and the Arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following many camera clicks, the Choctaw Marching Band played and the crowd sang “Happy Birthday” to MC as Thompson, Tushka, MC’s on-field personality, and student representatives blew out the candles on a three-tier Bicentennial birthday cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This once-in-a-lifetime celebration of MC’s 200th birthday united generations of students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends,” Thompson said. “I’m deeply grateful for those who have shaped our story and are inspired by the legacy we carry forward as we begin our next 200 years together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event kicked off MC’s Bicentennial Birthday Party and other celebratory events, which had been partially postponed by inclement weather during Founders Week in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students on the Campus Programming Board and MC’s Office of Student Engagement hosted a Bicentennial Birthday Party in the Piazza and Jennings Courtyard that included 200 cupcakes, a photo booth, food and drink vendors, and other activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “1826: The Exhibition,” which highlights the University’s rich history in a spectacular display created by the Institute for Southern Storytelling at MC, debuted in its namesake campus building, 1826. The exhibit will be open for visitors throughout the Bicentennial year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Bicentennial Time Capsule, scheduled to be packed with dozens of MC artifacts and reopened sometime in the future, was on display in one of the campus’s historic buildings, Jennings Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students and alumni who toured the exhibition and time capsule were simply astounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cody Scruggs, a sophomore computer science major from Terry, was fascinated by the exhibit’s display of technology used by MC students through the years, especially the old Macintosh personal computer and the early generation iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seeing all of these things paints a picture in your head of what life in a dorm room could have been like,” Scruggs said. “I’ve been passing by MC since I was 6 years old. Being able to say I was a student here for MC’s 200th birthday celebration is a privilege. Seeing all the different people who have been affiliated with MC being here to celebrate this is amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton residents Mary Alta Clark, a 1971 MC graduate, and her daughter, Kim Clark Pigott, who graduated from MC in 1986, participated in the photo recreation and stayed to tour the exhibit. They both recognized items from their respective college days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember my grandmother talking about being at Hillman College, which is represented (in the exhibit),” Pigott said. “A lot of our friends and my ex-classmates, people who I know through my children, are represented. I just love it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I loved the diorama of the campus,” Clark said. “It brings back a lot of old memories. I’ve enjoyed watching the different decades. I want to come back, take my time and read about everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livi Cate Osborne, a junior Christian Studies major from Birmingham, is the first in her family to attend MC. She said the Bicentennial celebration provides an opportunity for her to share the University’s rich history with her relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve loved being at MC, and it means so much to show them this place that I’ve made a home for myself,” she said. “I love history, so it’s special for me to be a part of the next 200 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That evening, MC’s Department of Christian Studies hosted a Bicentennial edition of the annual Evangelism Lecture. Shane Pruitt, national next gen director for the North American Mission Board, inspired audience members to take their faith seriously and to share their beliefs with the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a “Meet and Greet” with Mississippi College’s first Black graduates, the African American Studies program at MC presented “Success Starts at Mississippi College: Chronicles of MC’s African American Contributions to 200 Years of Celebration.” Moderated by Ellis Liddell ’80, co-chair of the Bicentennial Celebration Committee, the event featured MC alumni panelists Larry Myricks ’79, Maggie Wade ’20, Regina Schofield ’83, Camryn Johnson ’22, and Aaron Feazelle ’20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday morning, Feb. 13, Liddell, fellow members of the Bicentennial Celebration Committee, and guests witnessed Thompson unveil a sign outside Alumni Hall acknowledging the support of those “who helped ensure the success of this historic (Bicentennial) celebration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the brunch that followed, Jim Turcotte, MC vice president and special assistant to the president, recognized members of the Bicentennial Celebration Committee and Bicentennial Working Group and their efforts to make the Bicentennial Celebration a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am immensely grateful for the contributions of the MC Bicentennial Celebration Committee, the MC Bicentennial Working Group, and many other MC faculty, staff and student volunteers who have been the driving force behind our celebration activities,” Turcotte said. “I appreciate each of you and thank you from the bottom of my heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liddell closed by encouraging the committee members to continue telling the story of Mississippi College throughout its Bicentennial year and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a certain culture that we have as a result of who we are and how we grew up here,” Liddell said. “We must take that culture and share it with the rest of the world. This college has a purpose, and that’s what makes Mississippi College special.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The group alleged the chains were too short and too heavy, and that the dogs did not have proper shelter or water. The rescue also said the animals did not have required rabies vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than face potential citations, the people at the home relinquished the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheshire Abbey said it is currently at capacity following recent cold-weather rescues and plans to board the dogs while they are assessed. The rescue said it evaluates animals before adoption and does not place aggressive dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group praised law enforcement partners involved in the response and asked the community for donations to help cover boarding and veterinary costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can donate to their care on the rescue’s Facebook post by clicking below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These rescues cannot do this by themselves. It takes a village to help the forgotten dogs discarded in Mississippi every single day. It is exhausting for a small group to do alone…so whether you skip your daily $5 coffee and donate, that or reach out and offer to foster, we challenge you to do something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be something big or small…but please do something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Past champions have come from outside Mississippi, including winners from Georgia in 2023 and 2024 and a Texas dog named Forest last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the races, the Derby features the Boardtown Pizza and Pints Arts Festival, with nearly 200 approved food and art vendors. Other attractions include live music, a children’s zone, flyovers, the Old Dominick Call to Post, Mutt Juleps and an appearance by the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are so excited to welcome even more of our friends to the next edition of the world’s largest wiener dog race,” said Alden Thornhill, founder and host of the event. “Our team can’t wait to welcome so many new folks, both two- and four-legged, to the greatest show on turf on April 25th.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Derby has received multiple statewide and regional honors, including recognition from the Mississippi Tourism Association as Best Large Festival, the Mississippi Main Street Association as Best Creative Large Event and designation as a Top 20 Signature Event by the Southeast Tourism Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2023 by a group of friends seeking to create a spring festival in Starkville, the event supports the Oktibbeha County Humane Society and has raised more than $150,000 for shelter pets, according to organizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multi-camera HD broadcast of the races will begin at 11 a.m. CDT on the event’s YouTube channel and Facebook page. Organizers say the festival has generated millions of social media impressions while becoming one of Mississippi’s largest arts festivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information is available at thestarkvillederby.com.&lt;/p&gt;</ns1:encoded>

Additional adoption events will be held Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at PetSmart in Hattiesburg, and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Petco in Hattiesburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s event at PetSmart coincides with “Adopt Joy,” a partnership with PetSmart Charities aimed at connecting families with pets. Shelter officials said research shows pet ownership can benefit cognitive, physical and emotional wellness and help children learn values such as patience and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All adoptions include age-appropriate vaccinations, spay or neuter surgery, a microchip, 30 days of pet health insurance and a sample bag of food. The shelter said the reduced fees cover those services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1952, Southern Pines operates a no-kill shelter that cares for more than 4,000 lost and unwanted dogs and cats each year. The organization also runs a transport program, thrift shops in Hattiesburg and Oak Grove and a low-cost veterinary clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelter hours are noon to 5 p.m. Thursday through Tuesday. The shelter is closed Wednesdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said those unable to adopt can support the effort through donations to assist with the care of animals awaiting homes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A handwritten note left on a coworker’s desk. A stranger offering to carry groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those simple moments are at the heart of Random Acts of Kindness Day, observed annually on Feb. 17, a day dedicated to encouraging people to intentionally spread compassion in their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1995 in Denver, Colorado, by the nonprofit Random Acts of Kindness Foundation, the observance has grown into an international movement promoting everyday generosity. The organization later expanded the celebration into Random Acts of Kindness Week, emphasizing that kindness should extend far beyond a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Make Kindness the Norm, Not the Exception,” the foundation urges on its website, highlighting the social and emotional benefits of thoughtful actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research cited by the organization suggests kindness carries measurable health benefits. Acts of generosity can release hormones such as oxytocin and serotonin, which are associated with reduced stress and increased happiness. According to statistics shared by the foundation, people who regularly engage in kind behavior have 23% lower cortisol levels, and a 2020 survey found that 63% of adults reported improved mental health both from receiving and giving kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers say kindness also strengthens relationships in schools, workplaces and neighborhoods, helping build trust and empathy while breaking down social barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movement has attracted more than 261,000 self-described “RAKtivists” in 89 countries, according to RandomActsOfKindness.org . Participants receive a “Daily Dose of Kindness®” email with ideas and inspiration for incorporating compassion into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the observance is modern, advocates note that kindness itself is timeless. From community volunteers to global humanitarian figures, history has repeatedly shown how small actions can leave lasting impressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the day say participation does not require money or grand gestures. Holding a door, offering encouragement, checking on a neighbor or simply listening can create a ripple effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random Acts of Kindness Day serves as a reminder that meaningful change often begins with ordinary people choosing to act with care — one small gesture at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Organizers say the effort is designed to bridge the gap while residents wait for potential state or federal assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than establishing a single centralized donation site, participating churches and nonprofit partners are working through their own networks and channels to coordinate giving and distribute aid quickly where it is most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial assistance will focus on urgent needs affecting safety and housing stability, including electrical repairs, plumbing repairs, tree removal and debris hazards. Organizers said additional categories of support may be added as needs are assessed and resources grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents of the city of Oxford or Lafayette County experiencing verified storm-related hardship may request assistance through a community intake process. Walk-up intake hours will be held from 9 a.m. to noon Feb. 18 through Feb. 28 at the Old OPC Building, located under the Blue Oxford Water tower at 310 S. 15th St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Requests may also be submitted online at https://tinyurl.com/fernhelp or by calling 662-234-1100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applications will be reviewed by a collaborative assessment team led by Doors of Hope in partnership with the North Mississippi Exchange Family Center. The team will verify eligibility, prioritize urgent safety concerns and match approved cases with available resources. When possible, payments will be made directly to licensed vendors or service providers for verified repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participating church partners include Oxford-University United Methodist Church , First Baptist Church Oxford , First Presbyterian Church and St. Peter’s Episcopal Church . Community and nonprofit partners include Doors of Hope and the North Mississippi Exchange Family Center .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers are also building a network of licensed local vendors to assist with recovery work, prioritizing electrical and plumbing repairs and tree removal. Community members may submit vendor information through an online form. Participation in the network does not guarantee work assignments but allows businesses to be considered as recovery needs arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations interested in joining the coordinated fundraising effort may contact Chris McAlilly, lead pastor of Oxford-University United Methodist Church, at [email protected] .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers said the goal of the fund is to help neighbors recover, rebuild and remain safely housed through a shared community response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
